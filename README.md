# DisneyPlus-Clone

## Description

This project is a Disney Plus clone developed for educational purposes, aimed at understanding and practicing various modern web development technologies. It utilizes a stack of modern technologies including Vite.js, React, JavaScript, Redux, Firebase, and React Styled Components to recreate the functionality and user interface of Disney Plus for educational exploration and learning.

## Technologies
- **Vite.js**: A fast, modern build tool for web development. It focuses on providing a lightning-fast development experience while also delivering optimized production builds.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the state of their applications.
- **JavaScript**: The programming language of the web. JavaScript is essential for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.
- **Redux**: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps. Redux provides a centralized store for managing application state and enables efficient state updates through actions and reducers.
- **Firebase**: A platform for building web and mobile applications. Firebase provides a suite of backend services, including authentication, real-time database, and cloud storage, to help developers build and scale their applications.
- **React Styled Components**: A library for styling React components using tagged template literals. Styled Components allows developers to write CSS in JavaScript and create encapsulated, reusable styling components.
